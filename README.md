## About Minima
Minima is an undoubtedly simple and lightweight dark/light mode theme for Hexo. You can see the original [repository](https://github.com/adisaktijrs/hexo-theme-minima) for all information you need

## Why create this?
This repo holds my personal config and modifications from the upstream, but some commits have conflicts and the commits are different from master, hard to merge and clean.  
Stole a lot of from [Duchnovsky](https://github.com/pduchnovsky) and his [branch](https://github.com/pduchnovsky)!
